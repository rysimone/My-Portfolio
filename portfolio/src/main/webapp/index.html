      <h1>Ryan's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Ryan Simone and I am currently a Google Step Intern. I am a rising junior at the University of California Santa Barbara pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.</p>
      <p>I was born in Torrance, CA on August 18, 1999. I am the youngest, yet tallest, member of my family. As a child, I was nicknamed "Ry-Ry the beach going guy" because of my love for the beach. I played competetive soccer until college. </p>
